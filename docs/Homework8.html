    <h2>1. Conceptual Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Both the <strong>Law of Large Numbers (LLN)</strong> and the <strong>Random Walk</strong> simulations share a common probabilistic foundation: they arise from sequences of <strong>Bernoulli trials</strong>.
      A Bernoulli process consists of a set of independent experiments, each yielding only two possible outcomes — typically denoted as success (1) or failure (0), with constant probability <em>p</em> of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the LLN, we observe how the <em>relative frequency</em> of successes over <em>n</em> trials, defined as 
      <em>f(n) = (ΣX<sub>i</sub>)/n</em>, converges towards the true probability <em>p</em> as the number of observations increases.
      In contrast, the Random Walk simulation transforms these same outcomes into cumulative steps, assigning <em>+1</em> for a success and <em>−1</em> for a failure.
      This leads to the cumulative score:
      <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">S(n) = Σ (2X<sub>i</sub> − 1)</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Both perspectives, though different in focus — one on convergence, the other on distribution — describe the evolution of a stochastic process built upon the same elementary Bernoulli mechanism.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>2. Shared Mathematical Framework</h2>
    <p>
      In both experiments, the underlying distribution governing the number of successes in <em>n</em> trials is the <strong>binomial distribution</strong>:
      <em>P(X = k) = C(n,k) p<sup>k</sup> (1−p)<sup>n−k</sup></em>.
      Here, <em>C(n,k)</em> represents the number of possible combinations of <em>k</em> successes among <em>n</em> trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the LLN, this distribution governs how the empirical frequency <em>f(n)</em> fluctuates around the true probability <em>p</em> and gradually stabilizes with larger <em>n</em>.
      In the Random Walk, the same combinatorial structure defines the probabilities of achieving a final score <em>S = 2k − n</em>, showing how the empirical histogram converges toward the theoretical binomial curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep analogy lies in how <strong>statistical regularity</strong> (LLN) and <strong>probabilistic symmetry</strong> (Random Walk) are both consequences of binomially distributed discrete events.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>3. Pascal’s Triangle and Combinatorial Symmetry</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Pascal’s Triangle</strong> elegantly encodes all <em>binomial coefficients</em> <em>C(n,k)</em>, where each entry equals the sum of the two entries above it:
      <em>C(n,k) = C(n−1,k−1) + C(n−1,k)</em>.
      This recursive property mirrors the branching structure of all possible random walk trajectories, where each node represents a partial sum, and each step bifurcates into success or failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triangle also reveals the intrinsic <strong>symmetry</strong> of the binomial coefficients:
      <em>C(n,k) = C(n,n−k)</em>.
      In probabilistic terms, this symmetry reflects that the likelihood of obtaining <em>k</em> successes equals that of obtaining <em>k</em> failures when <em>p = 0.5</em> — the case of a perfectly symmetric random walk.

            cell.textContent = aboveLeft + above;
          }

  <div class="card">
    <h2>4. The Binomial Expansion and Its Probabilistic Meaning</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>binomial theorem</strong> provides the algebraic expansion:
      <em>(a + b)<sup>n</sup> = Σ C(n,k) a<sup>n−k</sup> b<sup>k</sup></em>.
      This expression not only defines the coefficients found in Pascal’s Triangle, but also forms the mathematical backbone of the binomial probability law.
    </p>
    <p>
      By identifying <em>a = (1−p)</em> and <em>b = p</em>, we can rewrite:
      <em>(1−p + p)<sup>n</sup> = Σ C(n,k) p<sup>k</sup>(1−p)<sup>n−k</sup> = 1</em>.
      This identity reflects the fact that the total probability across all possible outcomes in <em>n</em> Bernoulli trials equals one — a direct link between algebraic and probabilistic completeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, in random walks, this expansion symbolically represents all possible “paths” that a walker may take, each weighted by its probability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>5. Fibonacci Sequence and Recursive Relationships</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong>, though seemingly unrelated, emerges naturally from Pascal’s Triangle.  
      The sum of numbers along the shallow diagonals produces the Fibonacci numbers:
      1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This connection emphasizes the shared recursive nature of both systems.  
      In a random walk, each position depends only on the previous step — a recursion of state probabilities identical in spirit to how Fibonacci numbers depend on their two preceding terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, both Fibonacci recursion and Bernoulli processes illustrate a universal mathematical principle: complex structures can emerge from simple iterative rules.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>6. Broader Interpretations and Theoretical Insights</h2>
    <p>
      The connection between LLN and Random Walks extends beyond numerical simulation.  
      It highlights how randomness, when observed in aggregate, reveals stable, predictable patterns governed by combinatorial symmetry.
      Both experiments exemplify the transition from <strong>microscopic uncertainty</strong> to <strong>macroscopic regularity</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LLN focuses on long-term convergence — showing that relative frequencies stabilize toward theoretical probabilities.  
      The Random Walk focuses on probabilistic geometry — showing how cumulative paths form a distribution that converges to the binomial (and, in the limit, to the normal) distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, they illustrate the essence of probability theory: even when each trial is random, the ensemble behavior obeys precise mathematical laws.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Comparative Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Common Foundation:</strong> Both models originate from repeated Bernoulli trials.</li>
      <li><strong>Outcome Measure:</strong> LLN studies relative frequencies; Random Walks study cumulative sums.</li>
      <li><strong>Distributional Core:</strong> Both are governed by the binomial distribution and its coefficients.</li>
      <li><strong>Combinatorial Structure:</strong> Pascal’s Triangle mirrors possible paths of random evolution.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytic Expression:</strong> The binomial expansion connects algebraic form and probability.</li>
      <li><strong>Recursive Patterns:</strong> Fibonacci numbers and other combinatorial sequences emerge from the same recursive structure.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>8. Final Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The study of the Law of Large Numbers and the Random Walk demonstrates that probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra are not isolated branches of mathematics, but deeply interconnected.
      Through simple binary experiments, we observe the emergence of fundamental mathematical laws: convergence, symmetry, recursion, and structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The binomial coefficients serve as a bridge across these domains — counting possibilities, shaping probability distributions, and encoding recursive relationships that extend into fields such as statistics, computer science, and cryptography.
    </p>
    <p>
      In essence, both experiments — one focused on convergence, the other on distribution — reflect the same universal truth:  
      randomness, when structured and observed through the lens of combinatorics, reveals an elegant mathematical order underlying apparent chaos.
